# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Unbeatable AI

This is a Python implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human player (‘X’) competes against an AI (‘O’). The AI is powered by the Minimax Algorithm, making it unbeatable and guaranteeing that it will either win or result in a tie.

# Game Features

	•	Interactive Gameplay: The human player enters their moves through the command line.
	•	AI Opponent: The AI evaluates the board and calculates the optimal move using the minimax algorithm, ensuring it never loses.
	•	Winner and Tie Detection: The game continuously checks for winning combinations and detects when the board is full, declaring the game a tie if no winner is found.
	•	Efficient Move Calculation: The minimax algorithm is optimized to favor faster victories and prolong defeats, ensuring a robust AI strategy.

# Game Flow

	1.	The human player selects a move by entering a number (0-8) corresponding to the position on the 3x3 grid.
	2.	After the player’s move, the AI calculates the best possible move and updates the board.
	3.	The game checks for a winner after each turn or declares a tie when the board is full.

# Minimax Algorithm

The minimax algorithm is used by the AI to make its decisions:

	•	It simulates all possible future moves for both the human and the AI, assigning a score to each outcome.
	•	The AI selects the move that maximizes its chances of winning while minimizing the player’s chances.
	•	The algorithm ensures that the AI will always play optimally, making it impossible for the human to win.

# How to Play

	1.	Clone the repository.
	2.	Run the script in your Python environment.
	3.	Enter your moves when prompted and watch as the AI responds with its best possible move.

# Conclusion

This project demonstrates how game theory and algorithms like minimax can be applied to simple games to create intelligent, unbeatable opponents. The AI in this Tic-Tac-Toe game is designed to provide a challenging and fun experience for any player!
